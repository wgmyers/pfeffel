# Pfeffel

Like Wordle, but it lies to you.

Constantly.

About everything.

Ok, not everything. It doesn't lie about whether you have won or lost the game,
and it doesn't lie about what word it has chosen (see Absurdle below for that)
but it does consistently lie about the letter placements.

Normal Wordle marks your guesses as 'green' for correct, 'grey' for incorrect,
and 'sort of orangey brown' for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong
place.

Pfeffel could do this, but instead, will consistently lie about marks. So, if
a letter is marked 'green' still you don't know whether or not it is in the
word, but if it is, it isn't in that place.

It's just about playable if you squint.

## Can I try it?

Yes. It's [here](https://www.conniptions.org/pfeffel/).

I've tried to make it mobile friendly: if you have problems please let me know.

## Sorry, what is this?

This is a parody of the excellent word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

There are, by now, many many other Wordle parodies, but this is mine.

## I bet those are more fun

They are, I agree. Here are a few of them:

* [Sweardle](https://www.sweardle.com/) - A sweary variant
* [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/wordle/index.html) - An adversarial variant
* [Letterle](https://edjefferson.com/letterle/) - A minimalist variant

## I wonder if anyone has made a list of all the variants?

Why yes, they have.

It is [here](https://rwmpelstilzchen.gitlab.io/wordles/). Enjoy!
